That repository is the project that helps me practice working with Relational database by PostgreSQL. All the Bash commands is saved in universe.sql file. 
The main idea of the project is creating a relational database which shows information and relationships bewteen galaxies, planets, moons, and stars. Diverse types of relationships are included in universe database, which are one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.
